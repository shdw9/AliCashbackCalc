# AliCashbackCalc

AliCC is a **simple calculator** to calculate AliExpress dropshipping orders with Rakuten.

This is a useful tool for curious dropshippers on wondering how much cashback you've earned for that day since Rakuten takes a while to load AliExpress orders.

It will ask you how many orders you've made, ask how much the order was depending on the amount, and calculate the percentage.

There is also a feature to add a different cashback number if you are using a card that also gives cashback.
